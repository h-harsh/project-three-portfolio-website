            <p class="fonts-blog">The past Eight months from April 2020, the time when lockdown strated, This small part of time was one of the best one, like I am way more ahead in life where I was before, I don’t think this progress can happen in normal time, The main reason is I got time for myself, Today I am sharing few of my experience with some of the things learned on the way, This is purely based on experience </p>
            <p>  The first thing I am gonna talk about is Goal oriented learning, In the beginning I heard everybody saying this, mostly I heard varun mayya then I saw tanay sir he posted some videos on youtube about creating portfolio, his approach was also same like Don’t go and learn every topic first, set a goal then learn the things coming in  your way, When I saw that videos, I thought this is not a good way to go, Because till now I only believe in the way school taught me, And then I started learning html css and js through every point and topic, It was taking time, I was learning and learning many things and feeling like forgetting half of them. Like I didn’t kept any reward kind of thing, as I haven’t created any project then and I kept a goal as to become perfect in these. Then again I started tanay sir’s video and then finally I realized that this is only the right way, I can’t go and learn everything and then create something, They go hand in hand like I set a small goal then I learn the things needed in that, then moving like this ahead. Now within few days I have my portfolio ready my projects and everything, this works as a reward.
