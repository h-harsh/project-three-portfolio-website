            <p class="fonts-blog"> I wrote this blog at the time of Avalon Meta Finance Pro Leauges </p>
                <p> Stock markets are an easy money making thing, Surely this thought have crossed your mind once.
                I got into markets with the same thought that, I will be making lots of money just in a few months by becoming a full time trader
                Its gambling unless you don't know where and what you are doing with your money, like blindly investing or taking trades with someone else's call.
                I wasn't knowing that i am entering into markets as a Investor or a Trader, i was of the thinking to get rich quick,I took it as a career option
                While everybody around me was like the image posted(if you have watched his videos you can feel him saying)
                Let me show you a way for Anybody thinking about getting into stock markets </p>
                <p> There are two paths after opening the door named Stock Market
                Either you go as a Investor or a Trader</p>                
                <p> TRADER</p>
                <p> The most hype of easy money making are created by the fake people giving you courses on trading, (There are some real ones out there) 
                Trader is basically someone who do the buying and selling in markets on daily basis, takes his part of the profit/loss and move to the next day
                They take trades on the basis of their learnings called Technical analysis.
                It works some legit people out there are doing this, If you plan to go this way, Don't go for the hyped course in market which charges lot of money, Find a real person doing this, and become his student.</p>
                <p> INVESTOR</p>
                <p> These are the real ones i believe,
                As i got to know the things, i shifted from trader to Investor. They are the people who check the fundamentals of a company and buy and tend to hold stocks for a longer period which gives a good amount of returns.
                If you are planning to go this way (i recommend it)
                Everybody, everyone of any field, doing any work, must look at an Investors perspective once
                You just need some basic knowledge and you can start, slowly you will get to know more things, Its the most important part of your personal finance
                You can start from Shashank sir's videos or you can read zerodha varsity and many resources available in finance telegram group </p>
                <p> => These are my personal views from my small experience, Feedbacks appreciated </p>
