                I am not a science student, I am from commerce background but with a keen interest in Tech. What happened was I started learning html css for the first time by myself, then I did it for some time, I didn’t gave much time, but I did it, like learning step by step, Then due to I don’t know why I stopped for few months, then again I thought to start learning html css, The first time I started learning, I did no practice only seeing and learning, That was not much difficult, but when i started to think that I need to start again, Starting again was way too difficult then learning or anything, like it was good when I was continuing but when I stopped for some time and then trying to get back on the track is too difficult, like I postpone it everyday
                <p>There I realized that the most important is consistency in learning or we can say momentum, just don’t lose momentum.
